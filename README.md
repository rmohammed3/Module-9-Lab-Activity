# Module 9 Lab Activity â€“ While Loops

This repository contains Python programs developed for **CSS 225 - Module 9 Lab Activity**. The purpose of this module is to practice using `while` loops through small problem-solving exercises.

## Files and Descriptions

### `Problem1Infinite.py`
- **Description**: Contains a simple infinite loop that continuously prints `"Infinite"`.
- **Concepts Practiced**: Infinite loops, boolean logic.

### `Problem2NumList10.py`
- **Description**: Uses a while loop to generate a list from 0 to 10 and appends each number to a list.
- **Concepts Practiced**: List manipulation, counters, while conditionals.

### `Problem3NumList35.py`
- **Description**: Prompts the user to enter numbers repeatedly until the sum of all numbers entered exceeds 100. Appends all inputs to a list.
- **Concepts Practiced**: Input handling, list operations, loop control based on list sum.

### `Problem4NumListDivide.py`
- **Description**: Iterates through numbers from 0 to 50 using a counter and appends numbers divisible by 10 to a list.
- **Concepts Practiced**: Modulus operator, conditional logic, list appending.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement while loops.
- Use control structures to perform repeated actions.
- Learn to manipulate lists and conditional statements within loops.
